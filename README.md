> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Code is cheap. Architecture is expensive.**

The application code itself follows an **AI-Assisted Development methodology**. This approach was chosen to drastically minimize *time-to-market* for the frontend logic, shifting the engineering weight where it matters most:

| 🎯 Focus Area | 🛡️ Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure Robustness** | Proxmox HA-ready setup, Resource Isolation |
| **Deployment Pipelines** | Git-based workflow, Systemd automation |
| **Network Security** | Zero Trust (Cloudflare Tunnels), No Open Inbound Ports |
